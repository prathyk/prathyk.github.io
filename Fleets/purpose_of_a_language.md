Programming languages will be different from human languages. The main difference is that human languages deal with personalities. Persons have free will. They have feelings. But programming languages deal with matter. So, the consideration of impact on other people is minimal. 

Programming languages represent our understanding of the way matter works. Ultimately it is mathematics because that is our understanding of the world. But in practice, we build so many programming languages, why? If lambda itself is perfect programming language that can communicate anything to computers, then why invent more and more languages? Why do we need so many different ways of saying things?

Purpose of a programming language:
- It is a way to precise express ourselves to a machine
- It allows me to say things in a way which makes it difficult to shoot myself in the foot. Prevents easily avoidable mistakes.
- It allows me to model my real world matter
- It allows me to communicate (via model) with others. Precisely, clearly and easily. 
- It allows language authors to optimize 
- It gives quick feedback and quick results
- It helps us get work done quickly
- It is a way to think. It restricts (guides) our thinking.
- It makes me see the same situation from different perspectives. 
- It helps manipulate data easily
- Allows you to change what you said easily
- It restricts what you can do and makes some things more easier to do


There is a reason why making general purpose programming languages is difficult. Domain specific languages can be very efficient in many ways but that benefit comes from trading off the generality. 

Haskell uses pure lazy functions which helps you be honest by ensuring correctness. It helps you think in terms of data flows. 

Unison helps you write place agnostic code. It gives all benefits of pure functions and still helps you leverage effects.
