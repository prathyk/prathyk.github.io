Path exploration... 
Do you really need to get there 
Explore ways to get there 
Why some paths are hazy 
Is it an unknown or a blocker 
Any way out 
Now I have multiple paths. Which is better. Why


What should we do when someone comes with some requirement. As an architect, the first question I should ask if "why" do they need this. And then start exploring solutions outside software. 

Think of the solution as a place we need to reach like in a maze. The first question is "why should we reach that place at all?". Don't we have alternatives? Once it is confirmed that we definitely need to get to this particular destination(requirement), then we should explore various paths that can get us to that place. Now there is a DAG graph of possible paths. Some paths have some unknowns and others are blocked.

When you present the final solution, show it as a DAG with various paths to reach the goal and the cost, blockers, unknowns, intermediate solutions etc on it.
