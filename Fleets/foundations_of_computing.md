What enables computers?

All matter has the ability to present itself in perceivably different states. Those states can be discretized if required. 

Memory: Ability of matter to allow a state change and to sustain it with time.
Communication: Ability of matter to allow a state change and move with it in space.
processing: Predictability of state changes. 


These are the fundamental operations in manipulation of matter. Like a potter. He transforms (processes) matter in to different shapes. He finally gives matter a stable state which can travel in time and space. If a pot does not remain pot, then it is lost. Of course, matter remains as is unless touched by a living entity. So, all that we imply here is that to act as memory matter be able to sustain its state under normal conditions. 

A note about time and space. Time cannot change without space because if there is no change in space, then time change cannot be perceived. Space cannot be changed without time. Any change in space implies time. 

Matter is useful because it can have different states and it cannot change by itself and it changes (or can be changed) in specific predictable ways. 

The most powerful computers can be built from matter which can be changed predictably at high speeds and can travel at high speeds. 

So, we can think of memory, communication, and processing as the fundamental building blocks of computing. Then you can various kinds of memory like object store, file store, tabular store, etc. and various kinds of communication like internet, phone, queues, kafka etc. and various kinds of processing like events, functions etc. 

Various computers or different programs can be seen as combinations of these 3 fundamental building blocks. These are the legos and you are building the structure. But you build more reusable building blocks from these and then you can build the entire structure.
