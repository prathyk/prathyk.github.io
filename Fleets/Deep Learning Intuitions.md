Neural networks is all about approximating the world using a mathematical function. Can the world be emulated using mathematics?

This shouldn't be surprising because we have already been hearing voice recordings and video recordings which accurately capture the entire event as mathematics and then can replay it on demand. Cameras are able to capture pictures using maths. But, now a days AI is used to produce numbers of disk which sound exactly like real audio. They are able to cook-up these videos and audios. 

AI seems to be intelligent. This is confusing a lot of people who cannot understand the difference between knower and the known. Note that the numbers on the disk are making some sense and are able to speak, but only to us. An alien would probably think that it is noise. Within our limited visionary, auditory and mental spectrum we seem to make sense of them. What seems noise to us might make perfect sense to someone else. After all nothing in this world manifests without mathematics. Ultimately, it is pradhan that mixes with various permutations and combinations to create all the variety of things. This is the same idea that none of the computers have ever been able to generate a truly random number. Interesting, that the whole world came by chance but practically we are unable to produce a number by chance.

But it is interesting to note that even apparently creative things like writing a poem, singing a song, cooking a recipe etc are mathematical. So, all the famous artists can be replaced by AI. 

By living and absorbing in truth one can understand truth and be able to distinguish it from falsity. By being absorbed in falsity, one tends to believe that it is true. The more you read a false philosophy, the more you get attached and the less you are able to see higher truths. It is like trying to defeat scientists by reading science. Or trying to smoke so that we can convince people who smoke to stop smoking. 

Neural networks are the most crucial part of deep learning because they are shown to be universal approximators. There are practical limitations when you try to use neural networks to approximate things. But they are still able to do many things. They are just like the logic gates. We know that just a simple NAND gate can be used to create a Turing-Complete machine. Turing Complete machine is that which can compute anything that is ever computable. That means they can do anything which can be doable using an algorithm. 
The simplest of neural networks already have addition/subtraction operations (across neurons in one layer) and multiplication/division operations (across multiple neurons in different layers). Then the activation function can add many more operations to its instruction set. Using back-propagation you now learn the various weights on the equations to finally fit it to the problem at hand. Since back propagation works only with continuous functions, this neural network training method works only for continuous functions. 

## Components of a Neural Network
The main idea of AI is to emulate human intelligence so that it can help humans become productive(and lazy). For that it needs to understand the particular task at hand and try to learn the mathematics behind it, so that it can automate it. It is just like a calculator. But with things like computers and calculators you have to describe the mathematical algorithm that automates the task. However, with AI you do not have to describe each and every task as an algorithm. Rather, you write a very generic mathematical algorithm which learns the maths of any given task and then tries to automate it. There is still lot of programming done but AI can get very generic. 

Current the task of "predict the next word" seems to be a very generic task which can apparently be applied in many different applications. For example, it can also help with code generation. It can also be used to generate answers to questions or even call agents and thus prepare a sort of general AI which can autonomously execute tasks using other tools. This general task specification somehow enables LLM to imitate human speech which to a naive person seems intelligent. 

Anyways, for the task of predicting the next word or for any other task the following need to be taken care of:
1. Neural networks are functions over numbers. So, we need to first convert the text in to numbers. (Embedding)
2. The architecture of Neural network needs to prototype the kind of function which can nicely fit the given task
3. This function should be continuous because only then back propagation will work

### Embeddings
Words should be converted to numbers. But numbers already have a logical relationship between them. For example, 2 + 3 is 5. How do we assign numbers to words in such a way that the relationship between numbers is representation of relationship between words?

In any language, a word is always defined by things surrounding it. Every unique word does not have an objective meaning. The meaning is always context dependent. A dictionary usually points to a number of possible meanings but words do take newer meanings for people who carry some additional context along with them. Overall, the real meaning of a word is not taken from dictionary but it is taken from its context.

For example, if I see the following 3 sentences, I can understand some meanings: 
1. I ate banana
2. she ate orange
3. He got a stomach ache after eating guava

We can understand that banana, orange and guava are eatables. So, an LLM does not actually understand what 'eat' means. It does not even know that there are 'people' who usually 'eat' etc.. All that it knows is that banana, orange and guava are all related to 'eating'. So, it is just learning relationships between various words. 

Embeddings are a way to automatically learn the numbers that best represent our words in such a way that they represent inter-word relationships. 

## Architecture
This is just the overall structure of the function we are creating. This will determine the kinds of curves and the efficiency of training to get the right fit. 

If all of these match then we have a nice neural network which trains efficiently. 

The loss function is also the cost function which tries to model the cost of wrong prediction. So, we choose a loss function which approximates the actual cost of predicting something wrong. So, the loss function should depend on the practical application. 

We split test and train data but that split should be also done based on how we want to use the model. Are we trying to use the model for predicting missing data or future data? This will help you determine if the test samples must be picked up randomly from the middle or sequentially on the ends. 


## Why Machine learning is a flawed idea

Machine learning can never produce novel content, although it can deceptively imitate what humans do. The originality comes from humans. Now a days, due to advanced technology and increased bodily comforts, people are becoming lesser and lesser tolerant of any inconvenience. This makes them interact more and more with machines because dealing with machines needs no service mentality. After killing all the finer sentiments and relationships, technology is not reducing people in to mere machines. Everything people do is machine-like. Might as well replace everything with machines. Although, without life, AI is taking over the world as people are choosing to become enslaved by AI. Everything is superficial. If you dig deep, not even one doctor or one hospital is genuine. There are layers and layers of dishonesty. It is very difficult to even see basic truths. More than all of this, AI portrays itself as a living entity making people believe that people are no more than machines. 
Anyone who has done even slightly deeper work in any domain, quickly realizes that only life can inspire life. Only a heart can inspire another heart. People, having lost touch with their hearts, are unable to relate to the stories and lessons of our scriptures. If you desire to do welfare, if you want to set a good example, then why would you study this AI? The need of the hour is to live life heartily and show to people that there is different way to live. The new (traditional) way to live is to be happy and hearty.
